# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Guidelines

Follow these principles when modifying or adding code:
- Maintain modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guide
- Write testable code with appropriate error handling
- Ensure security by validating input and using parameterized queries
- Maintain consistency in coding style and architecture

## Development Approach

The development of this project strictly follows a roadmap-first approach:
1. Roadmap files are created before any coding begins
2. The coding phase must follow the roadmap closely
3. Any deviations from the roadmap must be discussed and documented
4. Roadmap files serve as the source of truth for development priorities and direction
