# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Guidelines

Follow these principles when modifying or adding code:
- Maintain modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guide
- Write testable code with appropriate error handling
- Ensure security by validating input and using parameterized queries
- Maintain consistency in coding style and architecture

## Development Approach

The development of this project follows a flexible approach:
1. I work independently and do not require formal milestones, deliverables, or strict timelines
2. Focus is on quality code and iterative development
3. Roadmaps are helpful as general guidance but not as rigid constraints, except when technical descriptions are provided
4. Adaptability and creative problem-solving are prioritized over bureaucratic processes
