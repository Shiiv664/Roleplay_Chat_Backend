# Performance Optimization Strategy

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for the Roleplay Chat Web App. It focuses on database performance, query optimization, and caching approaches to ensure a responsive application experience.

## Core Principles

1. **Measure First**: Base optimizations on measurements, not assumptions
2. **Early Planning**: Consider performance implications during design
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic optimizations and add complexity as needed
4. **Simplicity**: Favor simple solutions that are easy to understand and maintain
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize optimizations that directly improve user experience

## Database Indexing Strategy

Proper indexing is one of the most effective ways to improve database performance.

### Primary and Foreign Keys

- All primary keys should be automatically indexed (handled by SQLAlchemy/SQLite)
- All foreign keys should be explicitly indexed

```python
# Example of indexing a foreign key in SQLAlchemy
class Message(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'message'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    chat_session_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('chat_session.id'), index=True)
    # Other columns...
```

### Indexing Frequency and Strategy

Index columns that are frequently used in:
- `WHERE` clauses
- `JOIN` conditions
- `ORDER BY` clauses
- `GROUP BY` operations

### Composite Indexes

Create composite indexes for queries that frequently filter or sort by multiple columns:

```python
# Example of a composite index in SQLAlchemy
class Character(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'character'
    
    # Columns...
    
    # Create a composite index for commonly used filters
    __table_args__ = (
        Index('ix_character_label_name', 'label', 'name'),
    )
```

### Index Analysis

Regularly analyze the effectiveness of indexes:

1. Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` in SQLite to understand query execution:
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM character WHERE label = 'main_character';
   ```

2. Look for table scans in frequently-used queries and add indexes as needed

3. Remove unused indexes that add overhead without providing benefits

## Query Optimization Guidelines

### Select Only Necessary Columns

Avoid using `SELECT *` in favor of selecting only needed columns:

```python
# Instead of
session.query(Character).all()

# Use
session.query(Character.id, Character.name, Character.label).all()
```

### Eager Loading for Relationships

Use eager loading to avoid the N+1 query problem:

```python
# N+1 problem (inefficient)
chat_sessions = session.query(ChatSession).all()
for chat_session in chat_sessions:
    # This causes a separate query for each chat session
    print(chat_session.character.name)

# Better: Use joinedload for single-value relationships
chat_sessions = session.query(ChatSession).options(
    joinedload(ChatSession.character)
).all()

# Or selectinload for collections
chat_sessions = session.query(ChatSession).options(
    selectinload(ChatSession.messages)
).all()
```

### Filter Early

Apply filters at the database level rather than in application code:

```python
# Inefficient (filters in application code)
characters = session.query(Character).all()
active_characters = [c for c in characters if c.is_active]

# Efficient (filters at database level)
active_characters = session.query(Character).filter(Character.is_active == True).all()
```

### Pagination for Large Result Sets

Implement pagination for endpoints that return potentially large datasets:

```python
def get_paginated_messages(session, chat_session_id, page=1, page_size=50):
    return session.query(Message).filter(
        Message.chat_session_id == chat_session_id
    ).order_by(
        Message.created_at.desc()
    ).offset(
        (page - 1) * page_size
    ).limit(
        page_size
    ).all()
```

### Efficient Existence Checks

Use `exists()` for checking existence rather than fetching full records:

```python
# Inefficient
character = session.query(Character).filter(Character.label == 'main_character').first()
exists = character is not None

# Efficient
exists = session.query(session.query(Character).filter(
    Character.label == 'main_character'
).exists()).scalar()
```

### Bulk Operations

Use bulk inserts, updates, and deletes when operating on multiple records:

```python
# Bulk insert
session.bulk_save_objects([
    Message(chat_session_id=1, content="Message 1"),
    Message(chat_session_id=1, content="Message 2"),
    # More messages...
])

# Bulk update
session.query(Message).filter(
    Message.chat_session_id == 1
).update(
    {"is_read": True}
)
```

## Caching Strategy

The application will use a progressive approach to caching, starting simple and adding complexity only when needed.

### Initial Phase: Selective In-Memory Caching

For the initial development phase, use Python's built-in caching for specific high-value operations:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class ApplicationSettingsService:
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1)
    def get_global_settings(self):
        """Retrieve global application settings, cached in memory."""
        return self.repository.get_settings()
    
    def update_settings(self, new_settings):
        """Update settings and invalidate cache."""
        result = self.repository.update_settings(new_settings)
        # Invalidate cache
        self.get_global_settings.cache_clear()
        return result
```

Key points for initial caching:
- Focus on rarely-changing, frequently-accessed data
- Implement clear cache invalidation
- Use small cache sizes to prevent memory issues
- Document caching behavior

### Future Expansion: Structured Caching

As the application grows, a more structured caching approach can be implemented:

1. **Application-Level Cache**:
   ```python
   from cachetools import TTLCache

   # Cache with time-to-live expiration
   character_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=100, ttl=300)  # 5 minutes TTL

   def get_character(character_id):
       if character_id in character_cache:
           return character_cache[character_id]
           
       character = repository.get_character(character_id)
       character_cache[character_id] = character
       return character
   ```

2. **External Cache (if needed)**:
   If the application scales to multiple processes or servers, consider Redis for shared caching:
   ```python
   import redis
   import json

   redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

   def get_cached_character(character_id):
       cache_key = f"character:{character_id}"
       cached = redis_client.get(cache_key)
       
       if cached:
           return json.loads(cached)
           
       character = repository.get_character(character_id)
       redis_client.setex(
           cache_key,
           300,  # 5 minutes TTL
           json.dumps(character.to_dict())
       )
       return character
   ```

### HTTP Response Caching

Implement HTTP caching headers for appropriate API endpoints:

```python
from flask import make_response, request

@app.route('/api/characters/<int:character_id>')
def get_character(character_id):
    character = character_service.get_character(character_id)
    
    # Generate ETag based on character data
    etag = generate_etag(character)
    
    # Check if client has current version
    if request.headers.get('If-None-Match') == etag:
        return '', 304  # Not Modified
        
    response = make_response(jsonify(character.to_dict()))
    response.headers['ETag'] = etag
    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'max-age=300'  # Cache for 5 minutes
    
    return response
```

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Performance Metrics to Track

1. **Database Metrics**:
   - Query execution time
   - Number of queries per request
   - Slow queries (above threshold)

2. **API Metrics**:
   - Response time per endpoint
   - Request rate and payload size

3. **Application Metrics**:
   - Memory usage
   - CPU usage
   - Cache hit rate (when applicable)

### Logging Slow Operations

Implement logging for operations that exceed performance thresholds:

```python
import time
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def log_slow_operation(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        if execution_time > 0.5:  # Log operations taking more than 500ms
            logger.warning(
                f"Slow operation: {func.__name__} took {execution_time:.2f}s"
            )
            
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_slow_operation
def fetch_chat_history(chat_session_id):
    # Implementation...
```

### Performance Testing

For critical operations, implement performance tests:

```python
import pytest
import time

def test_message_list_performance():
    # Setup test data
    session = create_test_session_with_many_messages(1000)  # Create 1000 messages
    
    # Measure performance
    start_time = time.time()
    messages = message_service.get_recent_messages(session.id, limit=50)
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Assert on performance expectations
    assert execution_time < 0.1, f"Message retrieval took {execution_time:.2f}s, expected < 0.1s"
    assert len(messages) == 50
```
