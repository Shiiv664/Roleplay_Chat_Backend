# Dependencies Management Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing dependencies in the Roleplay Chat Web App. It provides guidelines for using Poetry as the dependency management tool, handling updates, and resolving conflicts.

## Core Principles

1. **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent environments across development and deployment
2. **Security**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
3. **Stability**: Balance between keeping dependencies updated and maintaining stability
4. **Minimalism**: Include only necessary dependencies to reduce complexity
5. **Documentation**: Document dependencies and their purposes

## Poetry as Dependency Management Tool

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is the chosen tool for managing project dependencies, packaging, and virtual environments.

### Why Poetry?

- **Modern Dependency Resolution**: Poetry uses a sophisticated dependency resolver
- **Lock File**: `poetry.lock` ensures exact versions for reproducible builds
- **Simplified Workflow**: Handles dependency management, virtual environments, and packaging
- **Project Isolation**: Creates isolated environments for each project
- **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive commands and clear error messages

### Basic Poetry Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new Poetry project (already done for this project)
poetry init

# Install all dependencies
poetry install

# Add a new dependency
poetry add flask

# Add a development dependency
poetry add --dev pytest

# Update all dependencies
poetry update

# Update a specific dependency
poetry update flask

# Run a command within the virtual environment
poetry run python app.py

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Export dependencies to requirements.txt (when needed)
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
```

## Project Configuration

### pyproject.toml Structure

Poetry uses `pyproject.toml` for project configuration. Keep it organized and well-documented:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "roleplay-chat"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A web application for AI roleplay chat sessions"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
flask = "^3.0.0"
sqlalchemy = "^2.0.0"
alembic = "^1.10.0"
pydantic = "^2.0.0"
structlog = "^23.1.0"
python-dotenv = "^1.0.0"
requests = "^2.28.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.3.1"
pytest-cov = "^4.1.0"
pytest-flask = "^1.2.0"
pytest-mock = "^3.10.0"
black = "^23.3.0"
isort = "^5.12.0"
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
flake8-bugbear = "^23.5.9"
flake8-comprehensions = "^3.13.0"
flake8-pytest-style = "^1.7.2"
flake8-docstrings = "^1.7.0"
mypy = "^1.3.0"
pre-commit = "^3.3.2"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ["py310"]
include = '\.pyi?$'

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_decorators = true
no_implicit_optional = true
strict_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = "test_*.py"
python_functions = "test_*"
```

### Dependency Documentation

Maintain clear documentation about dependencies, either in comments within `pyproject.toml` or in a separate file:

```markdown
# Project Dependencies

## Core Dependencies

- **flask**: Web framework
- **sqlalchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **alembic**: Database migration tool
- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **structlog**: Structured logging
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **requests**: HTTP client for OpenRouter API integration

## Development Dependencies

- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **black**, **isort**: Code formatters
- **flake8**: Linter with plugins
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pre-commit**: Pre-commit hook management
```

## Dependency Selection Guidelines

When adding dependencies, follow these guidelines:

1. **Evaluate Necessity**: Only add dependencies that provide significant value
2. **Favor Standard Library**: Use Python's standard library when appropriate
3. **Assess Project Health**:
   - Regular maintenance and updates
   - Active community
   - Adequate documentation
   - Test coverage
   - Security history
4. **License Compatibility**: Ensure license is compatible with the project
5. **Minimal Dependency Chain**: Prefer libraries with fewer sub-dependencies

### Tiered Approach to Dependencies

Organize dependencies in tiers:

1. **Core Dependencies**: Essential for the application to function
2. **Feature Dependencies**: Support specific features but aren't core
3. **Development Dependencies**: Only needed for development (testing, linting, etc.)
4. **Optional Dependencies**: Used for optional features

```toml
# Example of optional dependencies
[tool.poetry.extras]
monitor = ["prometheus-client", "opentelemetry-api"]
```

## Dependency Update Strategy

### Regular Update Schedule

Establish a regular schedule for updating dependencies:

1. **Weekly**: Check for security-related updates
2. **Monthly**: Update patch versions (bug fixes)
3. **Quarterly**: Evaluate minor version updates
4. **Yearly**: Consider major version updates

### Update Process

Follow this process when updating dependencies:

1. **Check for Updates**:
   ```bash
   poetry show --outdated
   ```

2. **Review Changelogs**: Before updating, review changelogs for breaking changes

3. **Update Selectively**:
   ```bash
   # Update a specific package
   poetry update flask

   # Update only patch versions
   poetry update --dry-run
   ```

4. **Run Tests**: After updating, run the full test suite
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

5. **Update Lock File**: If using version control, commit the updated lock file
   ```bash
   git add poetry.lock
   git commit -m "chore(deps): update dependencies"
   ```

### Security Updates

For security-related updates:

1. **Monitor Advisories**: Use tools to check for security issues
   ```bash
   # Install pip-audit
   pip install pip-audit

   # Check for vulnerabilities
   pip-audit
   ```

2. **Prioritize Security Fixes**: Update security-related packages immediately

3. **Document Security Updates**: Note security updates in commits and changelogs

## Dependency Conflict Resolution

### When Conflicts Arise

1. **Identify Conflicting Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install --verbose
   ```

2. **Understand Requirements**: Review the requirements of conflicting packages

3. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - Specify compatible versions using version constraints
   - Find alternative packages
   - Isolate conflicting dependencies in optional groups
   - Contact package maintainers if necessary

### Version Constraints

Use precise version constraints to resolve conflicts:

```toml
# Examples of version constraints
package_a = ">=1.0,<2.0"  # At least 1.0 but less than 2.0
package_b = "^1.2.3"      # At least 1.2.3 but less than 2.0.0
package_c = "~=1.2.3"     # At least 1.2.3 but less than 1.3.0
package_d = "==1.2.3"     # Exactly 1.2.3
```

### Dependency Groups

Use Poetry's dependency groups to manage conflicting dependencies:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
package_a = "^1.0"

[tool.poetry.group.alt.dependencies]
package_b = "^2.0"  # Conflicts with package_a

# Install without the alt group
# poetry install --without alt
```

## Virtual Environment Management

### Project-Specific Virtual Environments

Poetry creates a virtual environment per project:

```bash
# Check virtual environment information
poetry env info

# List all environments for the project
poetry env list

# Create a new environment
poetry env use python3.10

# Remove an environment
poetry env remove python3.10
```

### Global vs. Local Installation

For development, use Poetry's local virtual environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies locally (default)
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell

# Run a command in the virtual environment
poetry run python app.py
```

## CI/CD Integration

For future CI/CD integration, use Poetry in pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions configuration
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install Poetry
        uses: snok/install-poetry@v1
        with:
          version: 1.5.1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: poetry install
      - name: Run tests
        run: poetry run pytest
```

## Dependency Audit and Cleanup

Periodically review and clean up dependencies:

1. **Identify Unused Dependencies**:
   - Use tools like `pyflakes` or `vulture` to find unused imports
   - Manually review import statements
   - Check for deprecated dependencies

2. **Consolidate Similar Dependencies**:
   - Look for overlapping functionality
   - Standardize on fewer, more comprehensive packages

3. **Audit Dependency Size**:
   ```bash
   # Check dependency tree size
   poetry show --tree
   ```

4. **Remove Unnecessary Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry remove unused-package
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use the Lock File**: Commit `poetry.lock` to version control
2. **Document Dependency Choices**: Explain why specific dependencies were chosen
3. **Keep Dependencies Minimal**: Only add what's necessary
4. **Pin Major Versions**: Use `^` to allow minor and patch updates but prevent major breaking changes
5. **Periodic Clean-up**: Regularly review and remove unused dependencies
6. **Test After Updates**: Always run tests after dependency updates

## Conclusion

This dependencies management strategy provides a structured approach to handling Python packages throughout the Roleplay Chat Web App's lifecycle. By following these guidelines, the project will maintain a clean, up-to-date, and secure dependency tree while preventing issues related to version conflicts or compatibility problems.

Using Poetry as the primary dependency management tool provides a modern, reliable foundation for package handling, while the defined update and conflict resolution strategies ensure smooth ongoing maintenance. This approach balances the need to keep dependencies current with the stability requirements of a production application.
