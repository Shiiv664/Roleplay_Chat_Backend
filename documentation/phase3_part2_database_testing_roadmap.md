- Overall test coverage: 80%+

## Running and Verifying Tests

Set up commands and workflows for running and verifying tests:

1. **Test Command Configuration**

   - [ ] Enforce test passing for merges

## Model Test Examples

### Base Model Test Example

```python
def test_base_to_dict(db_session):
    """Test Base.to_dict() method."""
    character = Character(label="test_char", name="Test Character")
    db_session.add(character)
    db_session.commit()

    dict_data = character.to_dict()

    assert isinstance(dict_data, dict)
    assert dict_data["id"] == character.id
    assert dict_data["label"] == "test_char"
    assert dict_data["name"] == "Test Character"

def test_timestamp_mixin():
    """Test TimestampMixin adds created_at and updated_at."""
    character = Character(label="test_char", name="Test Character")

    assert hasattr(character, "created_at")
    assert hasattr(character, "updated_at")
```

### Character Model Test Example

```python
def test_character_creation():
    """Test Character model initialization."""
    character = Character(label="test_char", name="Test Character",
                          description="Test description")

    assert character.label == "test_char"
    assert character.name == "Test Character"
    assert character.description == "Test description"
    assert character.created_at is None  # Will be set on commit
    assert character.updated_at is None  # Will be set on commit

def test_character_unique_constraint(db_session):
    """Test Character.label unique constraint."""
    character1 = Character(label="unique_char", name="Character 1")
    db_session.add(character1)
    db_session.commit()

    character2 = Character(label="unique_char", name="Character 2")
    db_session.add(character2)

    # Should raise IntegrityError due to unique constraint
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        db_session.commit()
    db_session.rollback()
```
