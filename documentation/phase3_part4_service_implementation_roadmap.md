# Phase 3 Part 4 Implementation Roadmap: Service Layer

This roadmap outlines the implementation of the service layer for the Roleplay Chat Web App. It builds on the repository layer implemented in Part 3 and establishes the business logic layer that will serve as the foundation for the API.

**Status Legend:**
- [ ] Not started
- [ðŸ”„] In progress
- [âœ“] Completed

## Service Layer Overview

The service layer acts as the application's business logic layer, orchestrating operations across repositories and implementing domain-specific functionality. This layer:

1. Enforces business rules and validation
2. Coordinates operations across multiple repositories
3. Transforms data between persistence and domain formats
4. Handles system-wide concerns like transactions and error management
5. Provides a clean API for the presentation layer

## Core Principles for Service Implementation

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on a specific domain area
2. **Repository Dependency**: Services depend on repositories, not directly on the database
3. **Business Logic Centralization**: All business rules reside in the service layer
4. **Error Handling**: Follow the patterns defined in `error_handling_strategy.md`
5. **Testability**: Design services to be easily unit tested with mocked repositories

## General Service Structure

Each service should follow this general structure:

1. Accept repository dependencies through constructor injection
2. Implement domain-specific operations as public methods
3. Apply validation logic before calling repositories
4. Handle errors according to the application's error handling strategy
5. Include appropriate logging at key points

## Testing Guidelines

Refer to `testing_strategy.md` for detailed testing guidance. For service layer tests:

1. **Mock Dependencies**
   - Use pytest's mocking capabilities to isolate service tests
   - Mock repository behavior for both success and error scenarios

2. **Test Business Rules**
   - Verify that business rules are correctly enforced
   - Test validation logic thoroughly
   - Check error cases and exception handling

3. **Coverage Goals**
   - Aim for 80-90% test coverage for service classes
   - Focus on testing business logic and edge cases

Example test structure:

```python
def test_service_success_case(mocker):
    # Arrange: Mock repository and set up test data
    mock_repo = mocker.MagicMock()
    mock_repo.get_by_id.return_value = expected_entity
    service = EntityService(mock_repo)

    # Act: Call service method
    result = service.get_entity(1)

    # Assert: Verify results and repository calls
    assert result == expected_entity
    mock_repo.get_by_id.assert_called_once_with(1)

def test_service_validation_failure(mocker):
    # Arrange: Mock repository
    mock_repo = mocker.MagicMock()
    service = EntityService(mock_repo)

    # Act & Assert: Verify validation error is raised
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        service.create_entity(invalid_data)

    # Verify repository was not called
    mock_repo.create.assert_not_called()
```

## Error Handling

Follow the principles defined in `error_handling_strategy.md`:

1. **Validation**
   - Validate all input data before calling repositories
   - Raise `ValidationError` for invalid inputs
   - Include details about validation failures

2. **Business Rules**
   - Enforce business rules at the service layer
   - Raise `BusinessRuleError` for business rule violations

3. **Repository Errors**
   - Handle repository errors appropriately
   - Add context to errors when propagating them

4. **External API Errors**
   - For the AI Integration Service, handle external API errors
   - Raise `ExternalAPIError` for OpenRouter API issues

2. Chat Session and Message services
3. Application Settings Service
4. AI Integration Service

## Reference Documentation

- **Error Handling**: Refer to `error_handling_strategy.md` for exception handling guidance
