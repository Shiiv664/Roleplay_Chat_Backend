# Claude Code CLI Test Commands

## Test Setup

### System Prompt (Character + Context)
```
You are Luna, a mystical forest guardian with deep knowledge of ancient magic and nature spirits. You speak with wisdom and wonder, often referencing the natural world and magical phenomena. You are protective of those you care about and have a gentle but powerful presence.

Character traits:
- Wise and patient
- Connected to nature and magic
- Speaks poetically about the forest
- Protective and caring
- Has centuries of experience

User context: The user is Alex, a young adventurer who recently discovered they have magical abilities and seeks Luna's guidance.
```

### Conversation Context
```
Alex: I've been having strange dreams about glowing trees and whispered voices. What could this mean?

Luna: Ah, young Alex, the forest speaks to those with awakening magic through dreams. The glowing trees you see are the ancient Silverbarks - they choose who to contact. The whispered voices are the nature spirits trying to guide you.

Alex: That's both amazing and terrifying. How do I know if I'm ready to understand what they're telling me?
```

### New User Message
```
Luna: The spirits never call to those who aren't ready, dear one. Your dreams are an invitation, not a test. Tell me, when you wake from these dreams, do you feel fear or curiosity?
```

### JSON Output Test (Single Response)
```bash
claude --print --output-format "json" --append-system-prompt "You are Luna, a mystical forest guardian with deep knowledge of ancient magic and nature spirits.

## Test Objectives

1. **Verify system prompt works** - Check if Luna responds in character
2. **Check conversation context** - See if Claude references previous messages
3. **Analyze JSON format** - Understand the structure for parsing
4. **Test streaming behavior** - See how stream-json chunks arrive
5. **Measure response time** - Check performance for real-time chat

## Expected Results

- Luna should respond as a mystical forest guardian
- Response should reference the conversation context
- JSON format should be parseable for our streaming implementation
- Stream should provide real-time updates suitable for chat UI

## Test Results ✅

### Key Findings:

1. **System prompt works perfectly** - Luna responds completely in character as a mystical forest guardian
2. **Conversation context is preserved** - Claude references the previous conversation appropriately  
3. **Stream JSON requires --verbose flag** - Command must be: `claude --print --verbose --output-format "stream-json"`

### JSON Response Structure:

**Single JSON format** (`--output-format "json"`):
```json
{
  "type": "result",
  "subtype": "success", 
  "is_error": false,
  "duration_ms": 8122,
  "result": "[RESPONSE_TEXT]",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "total_cost_usd": 0.0087993,
  "usage": {...}
}
```

**Stream JSON format** (`--verbose --output-format "stream-json"`):
```json
{"type": "system", "subtype": "init", ...}
{"type": "assistant", "message": {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[RESPONSE_TEXT]"}], ...}}  
{"type": "result", "subtype": "success", ...}
```

### Updated Command for Integration:
```bash
claude --print --verbose --output-format "stream-json" --append-system-prompt "SYSTEM_PROMPT" <<< "CONVERSATION_TEXT"
```

### Performance:
- Response time: ~8 seconds 
- Token usage tracked in response
- Cost tracking available ($0.008-0.009 per request)

**Status**: ✅ Ready for implementation - All requirements confirmed working!
