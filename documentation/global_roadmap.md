# Global Project Roadmap: Roleplay Chat Web App

## Phase 1: Project Definition & Planning (completed)
- Define project scope and requirements (completed in Project_Description.md)
- Establish coding principles and standards (completed in AI_Coding_Principles.md)
- Create database schema (completed in database_schema.sql)

## Phase 2: Technical Architecture Design (completed in technical_architecture.md)
- Design detailed backend architecture
  - SQLAlchemy ORM models
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Service Layer
  - API Layer
- Design frontend architecture
  - UI components structure
  - API interaction modules
  - Core logic modules
- Design application state management
- Plan directory structure and file organization
- Document API endpoints

## Phase 3: Database & Backend Foundation
- Implement database setup with SQLAlchemy ORM (follow structure in technical_architecture.md)
- Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities (implement models as designed in technical_architecture.md)
  - Write unit tests for models (following testing_strategy.md)
- Implement repository pattern for database access (follow patterns in technical_architecture.md)
  - Write unit tests for repositories
- Implement basic service layer functionality
  - Write unit tests for services
- Develop core API endpoints for CRUD operations (based on API endpoints in technical_architecture.md)
  - Write unit tests for API endpoints
- Set up error handling and logging system (follow principles in error_handling_strategy.md)
  - Implement custom exception hierarchy
  - Configure layer-appropriate error handling
  - Set up global error handlers
  - Implement logging strategy
- ~~Implement authentication foundation~~ (not needed for local-only application)
- Set up test infrastructure (fixtures, utilities as outlined in testing_strategy.md)

## Phase 4: Frontend Foundation
- Set up basic frontend structure and build pipeline (follow directory structure in technical_architecture.md)
- Develop reusable UI components (as specified in technical_architecture.md)
- Implement API client for backend communication (based on API client designs in technical_architecture.md)
- Create base page templates
- Implement routing system

## Phase 5: Core Functionality Implementation
- Implement user profile management
- Implement character management
- Develop system prompt management
- Create AI model configuration
- Build application settings functionality
- Implement message handling and persistence

## Phase 6: Chat Interface Development
- Create dynamic chat interface
- Implement message display and formatting
- Develop dynamic session configuration controls
- Implement AI integration via OpenRouter API
- Build message sending and receiving workflow

## Phase 7: Home & Navigation Implementation
- Develop home page with recent chat sessions
- Implement character browsing and selection
- Create user profile selection interface
- Build navigation and menu system
- Implement session management for chat continuation

## Phase 8: Testing & Refinement
- Review and expand unit tests following testing_strategy.md
- Test error handling implementation as outlined in error_handling_strategy.md
  - Test exception raising in each application layer
  - Test global error handlers
  - Verify error responses match defined formats
- Perform integration testing of the complete application (if needed, as outlined in testing_strategy.md)
- Generate and analyze test coverage reports
- Optimize database queries and performance
- Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback
- Address any identified issues or bugs

## Phase 9: Documentation & Deployment
- Create user documentation
- Develop administrator/developer documentation
- Prepare deployment scripts and configurations
- Plan for production deployment
- Document future enhancement opportunities

## Phase 10: Launch & Maintenance
- Deploy application to production environment
- Monitor application performance
- Address any post-launch issues
- Gather user feedback
- Plan for future features and improvements
