## Phase 7: Home & Navigation Implementation
- Develop home page with recent chat sessions
- Implement character browsing and selection
- Create user profile selection interface
- Build navigation and menu system
- Implement session management for chat continuation

## Phase 8: Testing & Refinement
- Review and expand unit tests following testing_strategy.md
- Test error handling implementation as outlined in error_handling_strategy.md
  - Test exception raising in each application layer
  - Test global error handlers
  - Verify error responses match defined formats
- Perform performance testing and optimization following performance_optimization_strategy.md
  - Check indexing strategies and database query efficiency
  - Implement selective caching where beneficial
  - Monitor and optimize slow operations
- Test data migration and schema evolution processes outlined in database_schema_evolution_strategy.md
- Perform integration testing of the complete application (if needed, as outlined in testing_strategy.md)
- Generate and analyze test coverage reports
- Verify transaction handling works as expected (following transaction_management_strategy.md)
- Review configuration and deployment processes (following configuration_deployment_strategy.md)
- Assess and update dependencies (following dependencies_management_strategy.md)
- Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback
- Address any identified issues or bugs

## Phase 9: Documentation & Deployment
- Create user documentation
- Develop administrator/developer documentation
- Prepare deployment scripts and configurations
- Plan for production deployment
- Document future enhancement opportunities

## Phase 10: Launch & Maintenance
- Deploy application to production environment
- Monitor application performance
- Address any post-launch issues
- Gather user feedback
- Plan for future features and improvements
